## 🎯 How to Price Your Services

### Pricing Formula

**Cost-Based Pricing (Minimum):**
```
Annual living costs + business expenses + tax + savings
÷ 12 months
÷ Number of clients you want
= Minimum per client
```

**Value-Based Pricing (Better):**

Ask yourself:
- What transformation am I creating?
- What is that worth to the client?
- What would they pay to solve this problem?
- What are my competitors charging?
- What reflects my expertise and positioning?

**Premium Positioning:**
- Higher prices attract more committed clients
- People value what they pay for
- Premium pricing = premium results expected
- You can always discount, but hard to increase
